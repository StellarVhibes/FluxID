## 📝 Commit Guidelines

We follow a **Modular Commit** philosophy to ensure history is readable and revertable.

**The Golden Rule:**
> "Commit after every meaningful change, not every line."

- **Meaningful Change:** Completing a function, finishing a fix, adding a feature block, creating a file, or making a significant modification.
- **Avoid:** Micro-commits for single-line edits unless they are standalone fixes.
- **Frequency:** Commit often, but only when you finish a logical piece of work.

### Example Commit Messages

- `feat(frontend): add wallet connection flow`
